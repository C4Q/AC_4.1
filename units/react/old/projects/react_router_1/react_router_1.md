# React Router 1 - Personal Website

Use what we've learned so far in the _react 1_ lesson.

Build a personal website using react and react-router. You may use the [provided boilerplate](https://codesandbox.io/s/y087wqq0vj) as a starting point.

* Include a navigation bar and at least three different pages.
* Optional:
  * Style the website either by directly importing the `css` file into the `js`, or by using [javascript objects](https://reactjs.org/docs/dom-elements.html#style).
  * Include some icons using [fontAwesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). It is already loaded in `index.html` and an example usage of it appears in the `Welsome.js` component. Read the docs for more information.
  * Include custom fonts using [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). You may either load them under the `head` tag in `index.html` or directly in your css file.
