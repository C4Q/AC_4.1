# Movie Ratings

Using your Favorite Movies app from the previous project, add a means for a user to rate movies on a scale of 1 to 5 stars. **Do not change your movie data to include ratings - manage these ratings purely in state**. You are welcome to add more movies to make for more interesting seed data.

Create routes for each star rating and add links to allow users to filter movies by those ratings.
