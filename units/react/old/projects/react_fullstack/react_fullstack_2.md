# Validations, Search, and Style

In your Users/Phone Numbers app from yesterday, add two features:

## Validations

This means that two users can't have the same username or phone number. Duplicates should render a generic error message ("Error: Duplicate Fields") underneath the input field.

**Bonus:** Make error messages explicitly reference the column (username or phone number) that was duplicate. Two duplicates should produce two error messages.

## Search

Add a username search functionality to your "All Users" page.

**Bonus:** Add a phone number search functionality.

**Extra Bonus:** Include a limit on the number of users rendered on the "All Users" page. Searching should still query the database of all users. While, previously, you were probably searching through the state, this time, your search button should trigger an AJAX request.

## Styling

Make your app pretty. Add user images, if you'd like, or hover effects, or pretty colors. If you would like explicit design guidelines, see an instructor.
