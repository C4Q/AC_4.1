# Phone Numbers

Today, we're actually implementing a whole new feature, tip to tail. Wow.

## Part 1: Clone the Users App

Using the express-generator and create-react-app utilities, create a clone of the Users app from today's lecture. Include the ability to:

* Show all users
* Show one user
* Change a user's username
* Add a new user

Please try to look at the boilerplate code as little as possible - this is an opportunity for you to build this yourself and get a sense for how everything works. If you get stuck, feel free to ask an instructor or consult the [resource](https://daveceddia.com/create-react-app-express-backend/) provided.

## Part 2: Add Phone Numbers

Management has decided that our app is going to keep track of our users' phone numbers. Implement this as a column in the users table and make sure that:

* Adding a user includes an input for phone number
* Users display with their phone number
* Phone numbers are editable
