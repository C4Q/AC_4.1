#### Recipe

* Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have the following properties: `name`, `servings`, and `ingredients` (an array).
* Create a loop that logs the recipe information, so it looks like:

```javascript
name: Mole
servings: 2
ingredients:
cinnamon
cumin
cocoa
```

* **Bonus**: change the loop to log ingredients on the same line:

```javascript
name: Mole
servings: 2
ingredients: cinnamon, cumin, cocoa
```
