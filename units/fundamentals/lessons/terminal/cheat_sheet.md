`cmd` + `ctrl` + `UArrow/DArrow` : Move current line up/down

## Tip

* Use tab to autocomplete. for example, if the current folder has subfolders titled `games`, `photos` and `photography`, typing `pho` and pressing the tab key will result in displaying `photo` and `photography`. If we then type the letter `g` to get `photog`,and press the tab key - the command will be autocomplete to `photography`.
